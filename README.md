# react_complete_course
Completed Stephen Grider's fundamental React course (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/)


To run the streaming app:

- You will need node and npm installed
- clone this repository
- cd streams
- open 3 tabs in this directory
- navigate into api, client and rtmpserver folders (1 in each of the 3 tabs)
- run `npm i` in each folder to install required node dependencies
- then run `npm start` in each folder to start each instance
- client should automatically open in your browser on `localhost:3000`

What can be done: 
- sign in with Google OAuth
- CRUD operations. Streams can be: created, deleted, edited
- I streamed my desktop via a custom OBS stream (https://obsproject.com/) for testing. I set the stream to be the ith element in the array
